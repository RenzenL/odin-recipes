    <p>Here is a hearty, traditional meat and cheese lasagna recipe.</p>
    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the Meat Sauce:</h3>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (or a 50/50 mix of ground beef and mild Italian sausage)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the Ricotta Filling:</h3>
            <li>15 oz whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the Pasta & Cheese:</h3>
            <li>12 standard lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>Set your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions until al dente. Drain them and lay them flat on a piece of parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the meat sauce:</strong>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground meat and diced onions, cooking until the meat is browned. Drain any excess grease. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer on low for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the ricotta mixture:</strong>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan, egg, chopped parsley, and salt. Stir until completely blended.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the layers:</strong>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce across the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Lay 3 or 4 noodles over the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and spoon another cup of meat sauce over the cheese. Repeat this exact layering process two more times.</li>
            <li><strong>Top and bake:</strong>For the final layer, lay down the remaining noodles, cover them with the last of the meat sauce, and top with a heavy handful of mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the cheese:</strong>Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes until the cheese is melted, bubbling, and slightly golden.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest before slicing:</strong>Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before cutting into it. This allows the layers to set up so it doesn't fall apart on the plate.</li>

        </ol>
